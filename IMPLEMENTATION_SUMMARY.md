### 2. **Page Object Models (POM)** 
Four Page Objects were implemented following best practices:
- **LoginPage**: Login and error handling
- **InventoryPage**: Product and cart management
- **CartPage**: Shopping cart operations
- **CheckoutPage**: Complete checkout process

### 3. **Test Suite - 13 Automated Tests** 

#### **Login Flow (5 tests)**
-  Successful login with valid user
-  Error for locked out user
-  Error for invalid credentials
-  Error when username is missing
-  Error when password is missing

#### **Cart Management (5 tests)**
-  Add items to cart
-  Remove items from cart
-  Remove items from inventory
-  Maintain cart state when continuing shopping
-  Validate item count in badge

#### **E2E Purchase Flow (3 tests)**
-  Complete purchase flow (login → add → checkout → confirmation)
-  Purchase with a single item
-  Purchase with multiple items

### 4. **Configuration** 

#### **Playwright Config**
-  Chromium only (optimized for speed)
-  Parallel execution (4 workers in CI)
-  Timeouts: 60s per test, 45s navigation, 15s actions
-  Automatic retry: 2 attempts in CI, 1 locally
-  Screenshots on failures
-  Videos retained on failures
-  Trace on first retry
-  Reports: HTML + Allure

#### **Environment Variables**
-  `.env` file with test users
-  Secure passwords (not hardcoded)
-  Configurable base URL

### 5. **CI/CD - GitHub Actions** 

The workflow includes:
-  Trigger on: push, pull_request, schedule (daily 9 AM UTC), manual
-  Automatic dependency installation
-  Parallel test execution
-  Allure report generation
-  Automatic publishing to GitHub Pages
-  Index page with report links
-  Automatic PR comments with report links
-  Report history by build number

### 6. **Documentation** 
-  Complete README.md with:
  - Installation instructions
  - Configuration guide
  - Execution commands
  - Project structure
  - Design decisions
  - Guidelines for writing tests

## 🚀 Next Steps for Deployment

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Playwright test suite for SauceDemo"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/saucedemo-playwright-tests.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Source: **Deploy from a branch**
3. Branch: **gh-pages** → **/ (root)**
4. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Run the Workflow
The workflow will run automatically on the first push. Reports will be available at:
```
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/saucedemo-playwright-tests/
```


### Justified Design Decisions
- **Chromium Only**: Speed > Coverage (70%+ users use Chromium)
- **Parallel Execution**: Reduce execution time
- **Retry Strategy**: Handle network flakiness
- **Environment Variables**: Flexibility and security
- **Allure Reports**: Professional and detailed
